CDK Refactor aims to preserve AWS resources when you rename constructs, move resources between stacks, and reorganize CDK applications – operations that previously risked resource replacement.\nThe Problem When writing infrastructure as code with CDK, developers sometimes need to rename Constructs or move them between Stacks or directories. Whether they need to better organize code, follow coding best practices, or leverage object-oriented programming patterns like class inheritance, these changes can pose risks in environments with deployed resources, as they alter the logical IDs that CDK generates for those resources.\nDuring CDK deployment, AWS CloudFormation interprets these changes as new resources, often requiring deletion of existing resources and creation of new resources with new logical IDs. For stateful resources, this can cause potential downtime and even data loss.\nTo mitigate the impact of these ID changes, developers must stage their changes to create new resources, create data or network migration plans, then delete old resources to prevent these refactoring impacts. Sometimes, developers decide that the risk of these changes outweighs the benefits of refactoring and choose not to refactor.\nThe Solution Today, developers can use the new CDK refactor command to detect, review, validate, and safely apply refactored changes to their resources without replacing resources. This feature leverages the recently launched AWS CloudFormation refactoring capability, but CDK automatically calculates the mappings that CloudFormation needs to reidentify refactored resources, providing an abstraction layer that allows developers to focus on code rather than resource configuration.\nPrerequisites Along with the usual CDK prerequisites, if you bootstrapped your CDK project before this launch, you need to re-bootstrap your environment to get the new permissions related to CDK refactoring capability before attempting to refactor.\nExample: From Monolith to Microservices In this example, suppose we have a legacy CDK application deploying a monolithic Stack with Amazon DynamoDB tables for users, products, and orders, along with a single AWS Lambda function implementing CRUD operations on all entities.\nInitial Architecture (Monolith) function monolithApp() { const monolith = new CdkAppStack(app, monolithStackName, {env}); const usersTable = makeTable(monolith, \u0026#39;users\u0026#39;); const productsTable = makeTable(monolith, \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;); const ordersTable = makeTable(monolith, \u0026#39;orders\u0026#39;); // We have a single Lambda function in our application const func = new Function(monolith, `MonolithFunction`, { code: Code.fromInline(`Some code that accesses all three tables`), runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_22_X, handler: \u0026#39;index.handler\u0026#39;, }); usersTable.grantReadWriteData(func); productsTable.grantReadWriteData(func); ordersTable.grantReadWriteData(func); // This function creates a REST API, resources, methods, and links // everything together to the functions. Right now, we are passing // the same function in three places. makeApi(monolith, { usersFunction: func, productsFunction: func, ordersFunction: func, }); } monolithApp(); Refactoring Requirements We are asked to comply with Well Architected Framework best practices and split the monolith into separate Lambda functions so they can scale independently. Since they are very similar, we will also create an inheritable Lambda class that we can reuse to improve code readability and maintainability, while avoiding having to redefine uniform Lambda configuration settings across all functions.\nFinally, the monolith only uses CDK L1 Constructs. To further abstract the code and leverage helper functions, we will start using CDK L2 Constructs for DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway. This change will allow automatic definition of IAM Permissions and Roles, simplifying the code.\nThe proposed application is refactored into separate stacks for each domain. Without the refactoring feature, CloudFormation would delete and recreate resources, causing data loss.\nReplacing Stateless Resources Refactor CDK code to split the monolithic Lambda into 3 separate Lambdas:\nfunction singleStackMicroservicesApp() { const monolith = new CdkAppStack(app, monolithStackName, {env}); makeApi(monolith, { usersFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(monolith, \u0026#39;users\u0026#39;), productsFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(monolith, \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;), ordersFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(monolith, \u0026#39;orders\u0026#39;), }); } Refactoring Stateful Resources Create new stacks and move resources:\nfunction fullMicroservicesApp() { const monolith = new Stack(app, monolithStackName, {env}); const usersStack = new Stack(app, \u0026#39;Users\u0026#39;, {env}); const productsStack = new Stack(app, \u0026#39;Products\u0026#39;, {env}); const ordersStack = new Stack(app, \u0026#39;Orders\u0026#39;, {env}); makeApi(monolith, { usersFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(usersStack, \u0026#39;users\u0026#39;), productsFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(productsStack, \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;), ordersFunction: makeFunctionAndTable(ordersStack, \u0026#39;orders\u0026#39;), }); } Run cdk refactor --unstable=refactor to safely move resources without data loss.\nConclusion The CDK Refactor feature allows developers to confidently refactor infrastructure code, preserve AWS resources, and minimize risk.

Executive Summary The Document QA system is a serverless application designed to revolutionize how users interact with documents. By leveraging AWS Bedrock for Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology, the platform allows users to upload PDF/TXT documents and ask natural language questions. The system provides accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information from the uploaded documents, significantly reducing manual search time and improving information accessibility.\n2. Problem Statement What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Traditional document search methods (keyword matching) often fail to capture context or semantic meaning. Manual document review is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially for large volumes of text. Users struggle to extract specific insights quickly, leading to productivity bottlenecks.\nThe Solution We propose a Serverless RAG-based Chatbot using AWS Bedrock (Amazon Titan). The solution involves:\nUpload \u0026amp; Processing: Users upload documents to S3; Lambda functions trigger text extraction and embedding generation. Vector Search: Embeddings are stored and queried to find relevant document chunks. Generative AI: AWS Bedrock generates natural language responses based on the retrieved context. Serverless Architecture: Built on AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for automatic scaling and cost efficiency. Benefits and Return on Investment Efficiency: Reduces document analysis time from hours to seconds. Accuracy: RAG ensures answers are grounded in the provided document, minimizing hallucinations. Cost-Effective: Serverless pay-as-you-go model (estimated \u0026lt; $5/month for low usage). Scalability: Automatically handles varying loads without manual infrastructure management. 3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a modern serverless architecture to ensure scalability, security, and performance.\nAWS Services Used AWS Bedrock: Provides the Foundation Models (Amazon Titan) for embeddings and text generation. AWS Lambda: Serverless compute for handling API requests, document processing, and orchestration. Amazon API Gateway: Manages REST API endpoints for the frontend. Amazon S3: Stores raw uploaded documents and frontend static assets. Amazon DynamoDB: Manages user sessions and chat history. Vector Store: (Implemented via Lambda/Local or dedicated vector DB) Stores document embeddings for semantic search. Component Design Frontend: Hosted on S3 (or Amplify), providing a user-friendly chat interface. API Layer: API Gateway routes requests (/upload, /ask) to Lambda functions. Processing Layer: Lambda handles text extraction, calls Bedrock for embeddings, and performs vector similarity search. AI Layer: AWS Bedrock generates responses using the retrieved context and user query. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4): Setup AWS environment, Bedrock access, and basic backend logic. Phase 2: API \u0026amp; Security (Weeks 5-7): Develop API Gateway, Lambda functions, and implement CORS/Security. Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 8-11): Build the React/Next.js interface and integrate with APIs. Phase 4: Testing \u0026amp; Deployment (Weeks 12-14): End-to-end testing, optimization, and final deployment. Technical Requirements\nAI Model: Amazon Titan (via Bedrock) for Embeddings and Text Generation. Backend: Node.js/Python on AWS Lambda. Infrastructure as Code: Serverless Framework or AWS CDK. Frontend: React.js / Next.js. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Month 1: Architecture Design, AWS Setup, Backend Core (Upload/Embeddings). Month 2: RAG Implementation, Vector Search Logic, API Development. Month 3: Frontend Integration, UI/UX Polish, Testing, and Launch. 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Costs (Low-Medium Usage)\nAWS Bedrock (Titan): ~$0 (Free Tier / Low cost per 1k tokens) AWS Lambda: ~$0.20 per 1M requests Amazon S3: ~$0.023 per GB Amazon DynamoDB: ~$0.25 per 1M requests Amazon API Gateway: ~$3.50 per 1M requests Total Estimated: \u0026lt; $5.00 / month\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Hallucinations (AI Errors): Medium Impact, Medium Probability. Cost Overruns: Medium Impact, Low Probability (Serverless). Data Leakage: High Impact, Low Probability. Mitigation Strategies Hallucinations: Strict RAG implementation (grounding answers in context). Cost: Set AWS Budget Alerts and usage quotas. Security: Use Presigned URLs for S3, IAM roles with least privilege. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Fully automated document analysis pipeline. Sub-second retrieval latency for vector search. Scalable architecture supporting concurrent users. Long-term Value A reusable RAG framework for future knowledge base applications. Significant productivity gains for users needing quick information retrieval. 9.

Unprotected VINs in cloud environments risk:\nIdentity theft Vehicle theft Insurance fraud Privacy violations Regulatory non-compliance (GDPR, CCPA) Solution: Reference ID This solution introduces Reference ID as a pseudonym for VIN, enabling secure vehicle data interaction without exposing actual VINs.\nHow It Works The system uses Reference ID, where each vehicle receives a unique identifier (UUID) during provisioning, acting as a VIN proxy in all platform interactions. The vehicle registry database stores both hashed and encrypted versions of the VIN, mapped to the Reference ID.\nVINs are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) as a safeguard. When plain-text VIN retrieval is needed, this value can be decrypted, ensuring the actual VIN is only accessible when truly necessary.\nBenefits Acts as VIN proxy, enhancing security and data minimization Supports compliance with data protection regulations Provides flexible access control Improved auditability Scalability for large fleets Easier system interoperability Enables revocation without changing underlying VIN System Architecture 1. Reference ID Reference ID is a UUID generated during vehicle provisioning, serving as a VIN proxy throughout the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle, creating an abstraction layer protecting sensitive VIN data.\n2. Vehicle Registry Database The vehicle registry database serves as a centralized repository for vehicle information. Key features:\nReference ID to hashed VIN mapping Encrypted VIN storage Vehicle provisioning and state change tracking Device change history Vehicle attributes and configuration Database Structure:\nreferenceId – Partition key deviceId – Global secondary index hashedVin – Global secondary index tenantId encryptedVin 3. Vehicle Provisioning Process 3.1 Data Validation Provisioning infrastructure hashes VIN and queries database for first-time provisioning check For new vehicles, DEVICE_ID validated based on TCU manufacturer data Checks if DEVICE_ID already attached to another vehicle 3.2 Reference ID Generation Query database to validate if vehicle already provisioned If not, generate new UUID as Reference ID Store Reference ID, hashed VIN, and encrypted VIN (via KMS) Ensure UUID uniqueness 3.3 Certificate Generation Certificate generated using ACM PCA with Common Name = Reference ID 3.4 AWS IoT Integration Create AWS IoT Thing with Thing Name = Reference ID Create AWS IoT FleetWise Vehicle with Vehicle Name = Reference ID 3.5 Response Vehicle receives Certificate and Reference ID Vehicle connects to AWS IoT FleetWise using certificate and ClientId = ReferenceID 4. Data Collection and Storage 4.1 Vehicle to AWS IoT FleetWise Vehicle connects using Reference ID as Client ID All data associated with Reference ID 4.2 AWS IoT FleetWise to Data Platform Data enriched with Vehicle Name (Reference ID) 4.3 Storage and Retrieval Data stored with Reference ID as identifier Mobile app queries via API Platform using Reference ID 5. Customer Application Interaction 5.1 VIN to Reference ID Conversion After ownership verification, client app calls API for conversion API queries database to retrieve corresponding Reference ID Reference ID returned to application Security Considerations:\nStrict access control via authentication and authorization Log all conversion requests Rate limiting and DoS/DDoS protection Limit access to authorized applications 5.2 Using Reference ID After obtaining Reference ID, application can:\nRetrieve data from data platform Perform direct vehicle operations (remote commands) 6. Telematics Control Unit (TCU) Change 6.1 Update TCU Input: Hashed VIN (or Reference ID), current DEVICE_ID, new DEVICE_ID\nProcess:\nVerify hashed VIN and current DEVICE_ID Check new DEVICE_ID not linked to another vehicle Update DEVICE_ID in database Revoke and delete current certificate New TCU undergoes provisioning process 6.2 Remove TCU Input: Hashed VIN (or Reference ID), current DEVICE_ID\nProcess:\nVerify hashed VIN and DEVICE_ID Remove DEVICE_ID from database Revoke and delete certificate Security and Performance Considerations Security Minimizes VIN exposure risk in daily operations Only stores hashed and encrypted VINs AWS KMS encryption Strict access control policies Performance and Scalability Efficient UUID generation technology DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes for fast queries Scalability for large fleets Future Blockchain or distributed ledger integration Advanced analytics and machine learning Continuous GDPR and CCPA compliance Conclusion The Reference ID system helps automotive manufacturers enhance VIN security in connected vehicle platforms on AWS. This architecture:\nProtects sensitive vehicle data Maintains full functionality Scales efficiently Meets compliance standards Provides flexible framework for vehicle identity management As connected vehicle numbers continue to grow, robust security measures become critically important. This system not only protects VINs but also helps meet data protection requirements.\nYou should explore how to apply this approach to your connected vehicle solutions.

Dedicated mentors with high expertise, and opportunities to attend quality AWS events.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Suggestions to improve the internship experience:\nCreate a small \u0026ldquo;starter project\u0026rdquo; for interns to familiarize themselves with AWS services before joining the main project Would you like to continue this program in the future?\nYes, I would like to continue working with AWS, especially in the AI/ML field.\nAny other comments:\nThank you to the FCJ team and AWS for creating this wonderful opportunity. I learned so much not only about technical skills but also about working professionally in a world-leading tech company. I hope the program continues to grow and creates opportunities for more Vietnamese students!\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/1-worklog/1.7-week7/","title":"Week 7 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 7 Objectives: Master Amazon S3 and storage features.
