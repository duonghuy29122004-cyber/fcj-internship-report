> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS is highly professional and dynamic. The team is always ready to help when I encounter technical issues. The workspace is well-equipped with AWS tools and resources for experimentation and development.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor has deep knowledge of AWS services, guiding me from overall architecture. Importantly, the mentor always encourages me to research and propose solutions before asking, which helps develop independent thinking. The admin team provides excellent support with AWS account setup and permissions.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The Document QA project with AWS Bedrock aligns perfectly with my AI major. I applied knowledge of NLP, embeddings, and machine learning in practice. Additionally, I learned about cloud architecture, serverless computing, and production-grade AI systems - crucial knowledge not covered in detail at university.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Participated in 10 weeks of workshops covering AWS services, from basic to advanced. Especially attended 5 high-quality AWS events (Vietnam Cloud Day, Cloud Mastery Series), learning directly from Solutions Architects and experts. My mentor shared extensive real-world experience that helped me plan my career path in Cloud Computing.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. Networking with the AWS community in Vietnam through events. This made me feel like part of a larger cloud community, not just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
Free participation in AWS events, flexible working hours, learning environment with full resources. Could consider providing additional AWS credits for interns to practice.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
Attending 5 high-quality AWS events, learning directly from experts. Completing 10 weeks of workshops helped me gain a comprehensive view of the AWS ecosystem.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
- Provide a checklist of skills to achieve after each phase
- Provide specific learning paths for each technical domain (AI/ML, Backend, DevOps...)

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Absolutely! Dedicated mentors with high expertise, and opportunities to attend quality AWS events.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Suggestions to improve the internship experience:**
- Create a small "starter project" for interns to familiarize themselves with AWS services before joining the main project

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
Yes, I would like to continue working with AWS, especially in the AI/ML field.

**Any other comments:**  
Thank you to the FCJ team and AWS for creating this wonderful opportunity. I learned so much not only about technical skills but also about working professionally in a world-leading tech company. I hope the program continues to grow and creates opportunities for more Vietnamese students!
