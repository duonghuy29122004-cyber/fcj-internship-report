This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated:

###  [Blog 1 - AWS CDK Launches Refactoring Feature](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces the new AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) refactoring feature that makes infrastructure as code refactoring easier and safer. You will learn how CDK Refactor preserves AWS resources when renaming constructs, moving resources between stacks, and reorganizing CDK applications - operations that previously risked resource replacement. The article demonstrates a practical example of refactoring a monolithic application into microservices architecture, showing how to split Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables across separate stacks while maintaining data integrity and avoiding downtime.

###  [Blog 2 - Modern Observability Frameworks for SAP](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog explores modern observability solutions for SAP environments using PowerConnect and Dynatrace on AWS. You will learn how to address monitoring challenges in complex SAP ecosystems that span SAP Cloud ERP, SAP BTP, and AWS services. The article explains how PowerConnect collects observability signals from SAP systems and integrates with Dynatrace's AI-powered platform to provide comprehensive visibility, proactive issue detection, and automated root cause analysis. It includes detailed deployment architecture, pre-built dashboards, and integration with AWS AI services like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q.

###  [Blog 3 - Securing VIN with Reference ID on AWS IoT](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog presents a security solution for protecting Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) in connected vehicle platforms on AWS IoT. You will learn how to implement Reference ID as a pseudonym for VIN, enabling secure vehicle data interaction without exposing actual VINs. The article covers the complete architecture including vehicle provisioning process, database design with DynamoDB, certificate management with ACM PCA, integration with AWS IoT FleetWise, and handling TCU (Telematics Control Unit) changes. This approach helps automotive manufacturers comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA while maintaining full functionality.
