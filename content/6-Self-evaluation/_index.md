During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam** from **08/09/2025** to **12/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply AI/ML knowledge in a real-world environment working with cutting-edge AWS services.

I participated in developing a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Amazon Bedrock**.
Through this project, I significantly improved my skills in: **Python programming, serverless architecture, AI/ML engineering, natural language processing, and working with AWS services**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, proactively learned new technologies, and actively engaged with the team to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria                            | Description                                                                                      | Good | Fair | Average |
